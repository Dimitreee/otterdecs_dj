## Overview of Basic Program Functionality

The OtoDecks DJ application is designed as a dual-deck audio playback system, developed using the JUCE framework. It manages two independent DJ decks and handles audio mixing through its interconnected components. Users can load audio files, control playback with buttons, adjust volume and speed, and monitor the waveform display, which visualizes the track's progression in real-time. The system allows both decks to play simultaneously, ensuring smooth transitions between tracks.
